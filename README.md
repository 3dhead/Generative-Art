# Generative-Art
A selection generative art scripts written in Python, with the intention of using my AxiDraw to plot them onto paper.

These scripts export either a PNG or SVG file, you will need to dive into the code to change the variable which controls this, I usually call it `fileFormat`.


### Setup

These scripts have been made using Python 3.6.7

Install pyCairo, on Linux this very simple you just run the following command in a terminal window:

`sudo apt install python-cairo`

You will also need to install the Numpy package for Python which can be done using the following command:

`pip3 install numpy`

### Running Scripts

To run a script simply type the `python3` followed by the script name, for example:

`python3 Line_Grid.py`

This will run the script and save an image into the `/Images/Line_Grid` folder.

### Sample Images
